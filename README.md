# DevOps Full Practical Bootcamp Project 

# Goal
Throughout the project, we will explore various aspects of DevOps, including application development, containerization with Docker, creating CI/CD pipelines, managing Kubernetes clusters, and implementing effective monitoring practices.
<br> To Establish a Robust and Reliable Development process by settting version control using Git, implementing comprehensive Unit Tests, and setting up effective workflows to ensure that only properly tested code is merged from other branches into the Master branch.

## Requirements

Git clone initial code from this Github Repo - [https://github.com/iboofaye/devops-full-practical-bootcamp](https://github.com/iboofaye/devops-full-practical-bootcamp/tree/initial_starter_code)
```
git clone git@github.com:iboofaye/devops-full-practical-bootcamp.git
```
## Step 1 - Application Development

    Tools: Any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

## Step 2 - Dockerize Application

    Tools: Docker, Docker Compose

## Step 3 - Create a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Application

    Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI

## Step 4 - Continuous Testing

    Tools: JUnit, Mockito (for Java); pytest, unittest (for Python); Jasmine, Mocha (for JavaScript)

## Step 5 - K8s Cluster

    Tools: Minikube (for local development); Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (for cloud deployment)

## Step 6 - K8s Manifest Files

    Tools: YAML (for writing Kubernetes manifest files); kubectl (for deploying manifest files)

## Step 7 - Deploy Application to Kubernetes Cluster

    Tools: kubectl, Helm (for managing Kubernetes applications)

## Step 8 - Implement Monitoring and Logging

    Tools: Prometheus (for monitoring); ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd, Elasticsearch, Kibana (EFK) stack (for logging)

## Step 9 - Implement Scalability and High Availability

    Tools: Kubernetes features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Cluster Autoscaler, ReplicaSets

## Step 10 - Continuous Improvement

    Tools: Prometheus (for monitoring performance metrics); Grafana (for visualizing metrics); Kubernetes Dashboard (for monitoring Kubernetes cluster); SonarQube (for code quality analysis)

### As the the project comes to a close, it's important to reflect on the progress made so far.

## Future Scope Recommendations - 
<br> Now that the initial code is in place, it's time to focus on improving its quality. One way to do this is to add more checks such as linters, code coverage, and code quality checks. </br>
<br> Another recommended step is to add 'runs on' actions like a pull request. This allows for a more streamlined workflow and can help ensure that the code changes are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch. </br>

## Appendix
<br> This repository has three branches -
### 'main' branch contains the file code for the project
### 'initial_starter_code' contains the inital code to start with
### 'test' - The state of the project with test added for reference
</br>
